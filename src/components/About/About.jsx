              <p className="text">
                {" "}
                Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a deep passion for understanding
                people and creating solutions that make a real difference. My
                journey started in business administration and customer service,
                where I spent over nine years helping people, solving problems,
                and improving experiences. Whether managing operations in
                fast-paced environments or launching my own healthy pastry
                business, I learned the power of adaptability, precision, and
                truly listening to what people need. Now, I bring that same
                human-centered approach into tech, designing clean, minimalistic
                UIs that not only look beautiful but feel effortless to use. I
                believe that great design and seamless functionality go hand in
                hand, and I love building products that make life easier in ways
                people donâ€™t even realize. Moving to Canada on my own at the age
                17, pivoting my career into Tech, and starting a business from
                the ground up taught me to be resourceful, resilient, and
                fearless in the face of new challenges. I thrive in
                collaborative, fast-moving environments where I can keep
                learning, pushing boundaries, and building experiences that
                truly impact peopleâ€™s lives.
